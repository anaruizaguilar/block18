// Use a text editor to complete the following:

// You were hired by a global hotel chain to redesign the functionality of the button panel on their elevators. 
//The goal is to replace the outdated panel in over 1,200 different locations. Before you begin coding, you should make a list of all the ways these panels should be tested to make sure they are working correctly and respond to unexpected input in a way that makes sense. 
//Remember to consider happy and unhappy paths! 

// To complete this guided practice, write as many Unit Tests as possible. If time allows, write at least one integration, functional, and acceptance test. Be sure to label each test with its associated type (Unit, Integration, Functional, Acceptance).  

//Happy path
    //Panel accepts user input
    //Panel accepts input from more than one user at a time
    //Buttons light up when users press them
    //Announces wether the elevator is currenly ascending or descending
    //Elevator stops at the correct floor based on user input
    //Button light turns off when destination is reached
    //Open/close buttons open/close the elevator doors
    //Emergency button sends alert to building manager or maintenence technician



//Unhappy path
    //User presses button and it doesn't light up
    //Elevator stops at the wrong floor
    //Elevator stops at every floor despite user input
